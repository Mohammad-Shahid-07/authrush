# User Avatars

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

By default, Auth Rush provides a set of predefined avatar images that are randomly assigned to new users. These images are stored in an array of URLs in the `constants.ts` file:

```ts
export const ProfileUrls: ProfileUrl[] = [
  "https://utfs.io/f/34d50b7f-0bdc-4f80-a7c4-61154de964ec-ff5evf.jpg",
  "https://utfs.io/f/d47a792e-a6dc-4ab3-976b-8fc540685aa3-ff5evg.jpg",
  // ... more URLs
];
```

## Changing the Default Avatars

To change the default avatar images, you can simply replace the URLs in the `ProfileUrls` array with your desired image URLs. Here's how you can do it:

1. Locate the `constants.ts` file in the `@/lib` directory of your project.
2. Replace the existing URLs in the `ProfileUrls` array with the URLs of your new avatar images.
3. Save the changes, and the new avatar images will be used for new user registrations.

  Make sure that the new image URLs are valid and accessible. Also, keep in mind
  that using too many large images may impact the performance of your
  application.

## Adding Image Upload Functionality

Auth Rush currently does not provide built-in image upload functionality. However, this feature is planned for future versions of the library.
