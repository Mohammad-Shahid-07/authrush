# Auth Rush

While the majority of the code remains consistent across all databases, certain elements such as actions, database connections, schemas, and auth.config will vary.

## Database

<Cards>
  <Card title="Mongoose" href="/docs/core-components/auth-actions/mongoose" />
  <Card title="Prisma" href="/docs/core-components/auth-actions/prisma" />
